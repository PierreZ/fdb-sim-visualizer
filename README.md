# fdb-sim-visualizer

## Requirements

- Rust
- fdbserver (to generate traces)

If you are using nix, everything is already setup for you within the flake.

## Build it

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Generate traces

Run the simulation using the provided script:

```bash
./scripts/run_simulation.sh
```

This will generate trace logs in the `./events` directory.

## Parse traces

```bash
cargo run -- events/trace.0.0.0.0.69198.1745570893.x1jHWY.0.1.json
```

## Example of report

```text
‚ùØ cargo run -- events/trace.0.0.0.0.69198.1745570893.x1jHWY.0.1.json
Parsing log file: events/trace.0.0.0.0.69198.1745570893.x1jHWY.0.1.json
Parsed 1025 events.
